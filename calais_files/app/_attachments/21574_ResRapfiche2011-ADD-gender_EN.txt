 Format for Information Collection  -  Results Report 2009-2010 (gender) Embassy (for delegated aid) : Addis Ababa Country : Ethiopia Strategic Goal :  Gender/violence against women   This form is completed by : Metsehate Ayenekulu 1.  CONTEXT a .  Country  or regional  context   Unalterable  commitment to bring gender equity and equality is a prerequisite to attain all the MDG targets.  The fourth   generation  of the Ethiopian  PRSP,   the  ‘Growth and Transformation Plan’  (GTP)  has identified women as one of its pillar s  together with youth and children.   This is an   indicator  of the government ’ s  continu ous  commitment towards addressing gender inequality.       So far,  incontestable  results and  progresses  are  be ing registered ; however the  Ethiopian women, even today, are   facing discrimination on a number of fronts,  ranging from a higher  incidence of poverty to  a lack of  protection under the law, and from access to social services  to decision making power  (Development and change package of Ethiopian women: 2006) . b. Sector (thematic context) The ministry  which  deals with  women issue s  is moving a head and  taking steps  to bring about  gender parity  and equity .  However,   its operational and technical capacity is   far from the desired level. The very recent development of including youth and children ’s  issues  in   the Ministry’s mandate  ( 2010) is feared  to have a  potential loosening  (diminishing)  effect on the government’s commitment to address  gender  specific discrimination and injustice.   c. Description of the problem In spite  of all the investments, Ethiopian w omen  are still encountering a lot of   gender based  violence in its various forms (economic, social, political and cultural) . For instance  FGM/C  is practiced  with a national prevalence  of  74% including infibulations (prevalence of 83.8% and 63.2% in  Somali and Afar, respectively.)   W omen are  underrepresented in the formal sector (only 35.9% . )    85% of them justify their husbands beating them   (DHS:2005) .   It is  additionally recognized that there is an inextricable linkage between gender based violence and HIV/AIDS ,  leading to  the  feminization of HIV/AIDS. Stemming  from the underlying  gender inequality, women’s subjugation to early marriage, and limited access to information, poverty and weak negotiation capacity all lead to increasing women’s (particularly adolescent girls’) vulnerability to HIV and AIDS. About 70% of Ethiopian  women accept that wife beating is a norm, in some regions of the country more than 45% of girls are getting married be fore  the age of 18  (WHO:2002;  http://www.egldam-fgm-net/include/EM_ .)  Only 15 %  of  marri ed women  can make independent decisions  on their  own health and 1/3 of them reported  that their husbands decide with out consulting them. (DHS:2005) d. I nterve ntion logic In the Development  C ooperation  policy  of the Netherlands ,  the   respect of  rights of women and the fight against violence against women is a priority;  active participation  of women and girls  to decide on their needs and problems at all stages  and in all realms of life is another. In order to achieve results two forms of intervention have been identified: 1) gender specific activities, directly addressing the above issues and 2) mainstreaming gender issues in the existing development program of the Embassy.  Ad 1:  Strengthening the capacity of government and CSO institutions responsible for  the  protection and fighting for the  rights of women is one of our  strategic result area s .  The Embassy has been supporting programs on violence against women, women in peace building and conflict resolution, gender in leadership and decision making and women ’s   economic empowerment. As a consequence, it has been a pioneer contributor to  the gender pooled fund ,  designed to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of women, youth and children Affairs with a particular emphasis on strategic studies, capacity building, institutional strengthening and  creating a  participatory dialogue forum.  These  approaches  have to be as comp rehensive  and evidence based  as possible .  Ad 2: Results are less visible, but in the Education sector and Health and HIV.AIDS-related activities of the Embassy, the inclusion of gender issues in programmes (extra focus on girls’education and specific attention to the needs of women and girls in Health and HIV/AIDS activities are examples. 2.  RESULTS  ANDS LESSONS LEARNED What was achieved and why ? What made it happen? The gender and women related programs financed by t he Embassy have registered   hopeful  results.  The se  program s strengthen the  enabling environment to reduce VAW in partnership with local leaders, law enforcement structures and media, through support to the national Gender Based Violenc e Campaign Group Ethiopia and  strengthen ing  institutional and community based p rograms in support of care and s ocial support  to victims of violence with a  particular focus on adolescent girls and women in rural Ethiopia .  Th is  integrated approach  of awareness raising, institutional strenthening and direct support has created  greater impact. More than  500,000  people  have been  reached through awareness raising and advocacy activities. Government is on its way to endorse national working guidelines and communit ies   are  amending  their  customary laws and establishing local structures to make its environment  free from violence .  More than a thousand w omen and girls got  various services and support  including medical treatment, protection service,  psycho-social counselling and free legal aid .  The   women in  the  peace building and conflict resolution  project  (designed to contribute to the realization of UNSC 1325) , lately re-named to  women in disaster  and  risk reduction   has resulted in the p ublication of  a so-called  peace book, formation  of  community peace clubs, conducting capacity  building   conferences  and workshop s  for women and using media to promote the role of women in peace building and conflict resolution are  few of the achievements.  These outcomes have impacted in the form of less vio;lence in IDP- and refugee camps and a greater role of women in the implementation of Disaster Risk Management activities (for instance in the Productive Safety Net program.) The  co-funcing of  the gender pool ed  fund and the  DGGE  ( Donor Group on Gender Equality )  and sec tor working group engagements are   continuing . There is an ongoing debate with in  the DGGE  on  whether the gender pool fund should  incorporate  youth and children issue s  or concentrate only on women and gender issue s  as it  is doing now .  The embassy   is of the position  that the gender pool ed  fund  is  meant for pushing gender  higher on the political agenda and  that it should maintain this focus.  What went less well and why ? The Ministry had a plan to implement the O ne Plan, One Budget, One Report principle (known as CORE)  at the federal level after it was piloted at  the district level. The implementation was held up   because the ministry has been  restructured. As a consequence of its new mandate, the ministry is  now  also dealing with youth and children issues . Under the VAW program, CSOs and NGOs working on  the  provision of  free  legal aid for VAW  survivors  stopped working  as a consequence of the CSO law. Under the new law Ethiopian Resident NGOs are not allowed to work on advocacy and human rights regarding gender.    A ll the implementing partners of the VAW program are civil society organizations,  so  their performance is impacted and their free legal aid support  has  stopped.  As a result a n alternative way of strengthening community based organizations must be worked out.  Strengthening women friendly community based structures is one of the VAW ’s  program component s . A  mechanism needs to be designed so that these C S Os can provide legal aid. What has been learned ? The deployment by the Embassy  of  both mainstreaming and  stand   alone program implementation help ed  to address the problem of gender disparity com prehensively and to be evidence- based during policy debate and dialogue.  A lesson is  that the mainstreaming initiative needs careful design . It  has lent itself to misunderstanding and misuse resulting in  the  dilution of the effort for gender equality and equity. There is also a need  for the Embassy   to critically monitor  the impact of the in-country and out o f country policy changes on  gender programming and policy dialogue.  The CSO law, the restructuring within the Ministry  of Women Affairs  and  the   high interest of the government to bring growth and transformation within  a  short period of time are the current  main developments  in Ethiopia. Both the positive as well as the negative consequences of these  developments   on  the women movement of the country needs to be properly  tracked.  The magnitude of violence against women still calls for  an  extensive effort of all actors; the gains  that have been made should   be sustainable and  the remaining  areas of concern should be addressed   thoroughly .  3.
