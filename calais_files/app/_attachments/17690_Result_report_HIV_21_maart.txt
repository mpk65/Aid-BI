 Result report HIV/AIDS Zambia 2009-2010 Emb assy: Lusaka Country: Zambia Strategic goal: To contribute o the achievement of MDG 6: Bring a halt to killer diseases AIDS, Malaria and TB. This form is completed by Peter de Haan 1.  CONTEXT a. Country +  b.  Thematic  Context  Zambia forms part of the Southern African region wher e  4 % of the world’s population live; yet  more than 60% of all AIDS infections are to be found there. Most AIDS patients die during their productive years which has a negative effect on economic  growth .   A tragic consequence of the epidemic is the  large and  growing  number  of AIDS  o rphans and vulnerable children (OVCs).  The Zambian government is aware of the threat posed by HIV/AIDS and -greatly supported by the international donor community  and Zambian NGOs - is countering the epidemic by mass campaigns, treatment and by applying preventive measures. For further information on AIDS in the Southern African region, including Zambia see: www. unaids.org.zm   c. Description of the problem     There are two major problems and one emerging  one.   The first major problem is that there is no cure for AIDS. According to  researchers’  estimates it may take another 10 -20 years before  such a cure  will be developed. Hence, prevention is the only way to confront the epidemic.  The second problem concerns the risk groups in society. I t is now better understood which are the risk groups in societies, the so-called  driv e rs   of the  epidemic.  Conventional wisdom had it that the  major  risk group consisted of homosexual men, drug users and migrant  workers .  However,  recent evidence  confirms  that heterosexual adults constitute  the major risk group.  Concurrent sexual relationships amongst them  mainly  explain s  why AIDS is still spreading .  Zambia registers 8 2 ,000 new AIDS infections every year.  An  emerging problem  in Zambia is the slow but gradual decrease in donor funding for HIV/AIDS.  Bilateral donors either withdraw funding HIV/AIDS activities or  end  their support to  Zambia.  The Global Fund receives less financial contributions and PEPFAR may be under  threat  given the USA’s huge budget deficit.

Intervention logic T argeted preventive strategies are being implemented in Zambia such as concentrating prevention campaigns on the age group between 1 5  -24 year olds, with  special attention for  heterosexual couples in general and  women and girls  in particular .   M assive dis tribution of male and female condoms is being applied.  Male circum c i s ion has proven to be an effective preventive measure as well. This is now more and more practised in Zambia.  Rapid scaling up of Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT)  and prevention of mother-to-child transmission  (PMTCT)  centres are other effective means of intervention.  Thanks to all these preventive measu r es the AIDS prevalence rate has gone down  (see below).   Anti - retroviral treatment  (ART)  is  s uccessfully applied in Zambia, mainly thanks to PEPFAR and the Global Fund.    Home-based care for the bed-ridden and  those who lost their source of livelihood, is mainly provided by Zambian NGOs. The same applies to OVCs. However, as there are 1. 2  million OV C s in Zambia, a lot of them fall by the way side. Regarding dwindling donor funding, the government is being pressurized by Zambian   NGO’s to invest more in the fight against AIDS.  Some NGOs, such as CHAZ are actively p u rsuing  financial self-sufficiency.   2. RESULTS AND LESSIONS LEARNED  What has been achieved and why? What made it happen? According to  the latest Dem ographic  H ealth  S urvey  the  HIV/AIDS  prevalence percentage dropped from 16% in 20 01  to 14% in 2007.   The number of  VCT  sites increased from 250 in 2005 to 1,563 in 2008. P MTCT  services were rolled out to all   72 districts.  A major success is that  325,000 people  were  on ART treatment  in 2009 . If one compares this with only 70,000 people  on treatment  in 2006, th is  almost 5 times increase is impressive .  This is  mainly thanks to  PEPFAR   who  supplied ARTs for  286,000  people in 2009.  The Global Fund was the second large d  contributor in this realm. Whilst PEPFAR is mainly working through Amer i can organisations,   the Global Fund channels its finding through  4  principal recipients:  the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Finance, and two Za m bian NGOs: the Churches Health Association of Zambia  (CHAZ)  and the Zambian National A ID S  N etwork (ZNAN).   Both CHAZ and ZNAN are also being funded by this Embassy together with a few other donors .   In close consultation with th is Embassy   and other  donors,  who emphasized attention for prevention, food security and sexual reproductive gender rights ,  CHAZ and ZNAN  achieved the following in 2010:  360,000 people reached through various prevention measures; m aterial support (including schooling) to 11,300 OVCs; 19,6 00 people benefited f r om  food security programs; 60,800 people (mainly women and girls) benefitted from sexual reproductive gender rights programs.   What went less well and why?   Given the fact that more than 80,000 people are being infected with the virus every year, this means that prevention is not  yet  effective  enough  and that quite a few sexually active Zambians need to change their promiscuous behaviour. Another set - back concerns the  consequences  of the corruption scam at the  M inistry of  H e a lth in 2009. The Global Fund suspended its financial support to the  M inistry .  UNDP is now charged with strengthening the financial and accountability capacities of this Ministry until such time that it can regain its principal recipient status. Meanwhile the Global Fund did not stop funding life saving medicines  in order not to interrupt anti-retroviral treatment ; these are now procured by UNDP.  T wo huge challenges are yet to be confronted: 1.   T he large number of OVCs  who  are not properly catered for.  It is mainly grandparents, community schools, the Social Protection Extension Programme and NGOs who cater to them, yet not all are receiving help. 2.  The  likelihood that foreign funding will go down. On top of this, once Zambia will reach the status of lower middle income country ,  it will have to pay the full price for ARTs, which are now provided for a subsidized price. Government ’ s funding of AIDS related costs  are very small(less than 2 % of its budget), and over the past few years there was no rising trend in it.   What has been learned?                   The AIDS epidemic is not yet under control. A more effective and targeted prevention approach , which  -as stated above-  is now being applied, will  be  more effective. New preventive measures such as male circumcision  should  be   boosted.  OVCs need much more attention to give them a chance for a better  future .  Although successes have been achieved in the growing number of people under treatment -  the likelihood of less foreign funding puts a heavy burden on the government’s  future  budget. 3.
